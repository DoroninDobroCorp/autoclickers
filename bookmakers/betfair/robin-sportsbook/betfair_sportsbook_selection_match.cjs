// Pure helpers for the Story 2.4 fix: "Handicap/Totals selection matching --
// клик по odds-кнопке". Live diagnosis (2026-07-15, dev) confirmed the exact
// root cause: Betfair renders a handicap/totals runner as TWO SEPARATE
// buttons -- a name/line button ("James Kent Trotter (+4.5)", "Over 2.5")
// and a numeric odds button ("1.67") -- while Moneyline/Match Odds renders
// name+odds COMBINED in one button ("Team A 2.10"). clickExactSelection
// (betfair_sportsbook_basket_worker.cjs) used to click whichever button's
// raw text matched the wanted selection via climbToMarketContainer
// (betfair_sportsbook_market_boundary.cjs) -- on handicap/totals that is the
// name button, and clicking it does NOT add anything to the betslip
// (confirmed live: sportsbookBettingState STATE_LEN 0 after the click).
//
// climbToMarketContainer itself is untouched by this fix -- it already
// reliably (4 rounds of Story 2.2b hardening) finds the correct, unambiguous
// NAME/line button scoped to the right market. What was missing is knowing
// WHICH button to actually click:
//   - Moneyline/Match Odds: name+odds are the SAME button -> click it.
//   - Handicap/Totals: a SEPARATE odds button sits next to the name button
//     -> climb from the name button to find it.
//
// Kept dependency-free and Playwright-free (like betfair_sportsbook_market_
// boundary.cjs / betfair_sportsbook_market_identity.cjs) so the ACTUAL
// algorithm can be unit tested with node:test, both as pure string functions
// and (for findAdjacentOddsButton) against a synthetic fake-DOM tree, and
// also passed as-is into Playwright's evaluateHandle() to run for real in
// the browser -- it only touches its own arguments (node.parentElement,
// node.querySelectorAll(), button.innerText) and never closes over anything
// from the outer module scope, so its source is safe to serialize into the
// page (same constraint documented in betfair_sportsbook_market_boundary.cjs).

//
// Fix-round-1 (P1) and fix-round-2 (P1) both assumed a runner has its own
// per-runner ROW CONTAINER wrapping exactly its name+odds buttons, and tried
// to climb/prove that container's boundary. A live structural DOM dump
// (2026-07-15, Game Handicap -4.5) proved that model wrong: Betfair does NOT
// wrap each runner in its own row. Every button of the whole market -- every
// runner's name AND odds -- is a direct sibling of ONE shared container, in
// strict render order:
//   [name1][odds1][name2][odds2] ... [nameN][oddsN]
// There is no per-runner boundary to find or prove; fix-round-2's "exactly
// one other direct child, itself a bare odds-shaped button" check never
// holds on this shape once a market has more than one runner (there are
// always more than one "other direct child" once a second runner's buttons
// are siblings too) -- so it fail-closed to null on every real handicap
// market, which is the "Selection not found" regression this fix addresses.
//
// Fix-round-3 assumed the whole market's buttons (every runner's name AND
// odds) sit as FLAT siblings of one shared container, with a runner's own
// odds being its name button's bare `nextElementSibling`. A PRECISE
// structural DOM dump (2026-07-15, Game Handicap -4.5, captured node-by-node
// rather than eyeballed) proved that wrong too: Betfair DOES wrap each
// runner in its own per-runner container after all --
//   div.runnerLine                                     <- per-runner container
//     |- button.runnerInnerContent "James Kent Trotter (+4.5)"  <- name button
//     `- div.sportsbookButton "1.67"                    <- a DIV wrapper, NOT a button
//          `- button.button "1.67"                      <- the REAL odds button, INSIDE the wrapper
// name.parentElement is div.runnerLine (exactly this one runner's name +
// odds-wrapper, nothing else). name.nextElementSibling is the wrapper DIV,
// not a button -- which is exactly why fix-round-3 (which only ever checked
// whether the next sibling itself was a bare odds-shaped <button>) always
// found null on this shape: the real odds <button> is one level deeper,
// INSIDE that wrapper div, not a sibling of the name button at all.
//
// Fix-round-4: climb from the name button to its parentElement (the
// per-runner `runnerLine`) and search for the odds button WITHIN that
// runnerLine only, via `querySelectorAll("button")` -- a scoped, bounded
// search of exactly this one runner's own subtree, excluding the name
// button itself. This transparently covers BOTH confirmed real shapes:
//   - wrapped (the precise dump above): odds <button> nested one level
//     inside a `div.sportsbookButton` wrapper -> querySelectorAll finds it
//     via a normal descendant search.
//   - simple (older/alternate layout, kept for robustness): odds <button>
//     is itself a DIRECT child of runnerLine, no wrapper div -> also found
//     by the same querySelectorAll("button") scan.
// Money-safe: `runnerLine` is per-runner by construction (it is exactly
// `nameNode.parentElement`, nothing shared with any other runner), so the
// search can never cross into a neighbouring runner's own name/odds pair.
//   - normal runner:    exactly one odds-shaped <button> found inside
//     runnerLine (besides the name button itself) -> that is its own odds.
//   - suspended runner:  zero odds-shaped <button>s inside runnerLine (no
//     odds rendered at all for it) -> null, fail-closed. Never reaches into
//     a sibling runnerLine to borrow a neighbour's price.
//   - more than one odds-shaped <button> inside runnerLine (an
//     unanticipated/ambiguous shape) -> null with `ambiguous: true` rather
//     than guessing which one is the real odds button.
// Also fails closed to null when `nameNode` has no `parentElement` at all
// (orphan/root node, no runnerLine to search). `arg` is accepted but unused
// -- kept so the existing evaluateHandle(findAdjacentOddsButton,
// { maxDepth: 5 }) call sites do not need to change.
//
// Fix-round-5 (P1): fix-round-4 climbed to `nameNode.parentElement` and
// TRUSTED it to be the per-runner `runnerLine` boundary -- it never actually
// validated that. codex re-review found the hole: if a target runner's name
// button ever shares its immediate parent with a NEIGHBOURING runner (e.g.
// one shared list/row container instead of each runner having its own
// `div.runnerLine`), the querySelectorAll("button") scan below would happily
// pick up the neighbour's own odds button and return it as the target's own
// price -- a silent wrong-runner match (`ambiguous: false`, money-unsafe;
// reproduced with [suspended target name, neighbour label, neighbour
// sportsbookButton-wrapper > odds] all under one shared parent). Fix:
// validate `parentElement` actually IS a per-runner boundary -- its
// `className` must contain the confirmed `runnerLine` marker (from the
// precise dump, `class ~ "_XXXrunnerLine"`, case-insensitive) -- BEFORE
// searching it at all. An unrecognised/shared parent shape never falls back
// to searching anyway; it fails closed to null.
//
// Fix-round-6 (P1): fix-round-5's boundary check, `/runnerline/i.test(
// runnerLine.className)`, is a SUBSTRING test over the WHOLE className
// string -- it matches "runnerline" ANYWHERE in the string, not just as a
// genuine per-runner marker. codex re-review found a common/shared parent
// classed `"_a1b2-runnerLinesContainer"` still contains the substring
// "runnerline" (inside "runnerLinesContainer") and would WRONGLY pass the
// boundary check -- the exact wrong-runner leak fix-round-5 was meant to
// close, reached via a different className shape. Fix: split className into
// individual class tokens (on whitespace) and require at least one TOKEN to
// itself END WITH "runnerLine" (case-insensitive), plus `tagName ===
// "DIV"`. Anchoring to the end of the token rejects "runnerLinesContainer"
// and "runnerLines" (plural) -- neither ends with "runnerLine" -- while
// still accepting "_a1b2runnerLine" and dash-separated "_HASH-runnerLine".
